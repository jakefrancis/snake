# Snake üêç

Pure JS implementation of the game Snake.
Mobile and touch friendly.

## Controls

Use the Arrow Keys to move the snake or 
swipe in the direction you want the snake to move on mobile.

## Rules

Move the snake towards it's food source, everytime a piece of food is consumed the snake grows by one segment.
The edges of the game area wrap, i.e. if the snake is traveling to the right and moves off the screen, the head of the snake will 'wrap' around and appear on the left edge of the screen.

## Installation

Simply download this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.

Hosted version of the game coming soon.
